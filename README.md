# NullSens-Matlab


NullSens is a method for partitioning variation explained by environmental factors and species interactions in community abundance data. This is a Matlab implementation for evaluating the performance of NullSens on simulated communities. More detail on the method may be found in my [THESIS](http://www.sessinger.com/Publications/thesis_manuscript_final_essinger.pdf). Chapter 5 provides a description of the method as implemented here.
